*The child who refuses to travel in the father's harness, this is the symbol of man's most unique capability. I do not have to be what my father was. &ldquo;I do not have to obey my father's rules or even believe everything he believed. It is my strength as a human that I can make my own choices of what to believe and what not to believe, of what to be and what not to be.&rdquo;*

&mdash; Frank Herbert, *Children of Dune*
