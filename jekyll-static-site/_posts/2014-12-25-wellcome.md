Hi there! I'm glad you are here, because a lot of love and effort have been put in crafting this site. So, to begin with, welcome to my blog! I hope it takes off pretty soon with some articles. But, what is this all about? Well, let me tell you!

## What goes here ##

This is a place for techie articles and techie rants and techie experiencies of any kind. It is a space to share and discuss some things I may find along the way as an Android developer, for example, or learning some bits of web development or anything related to computer science that might be interesting. I do not rule out to lay some other thoughts here too - sports, books and culture in general and, perhaps, some other more philosophical entanglements.


#### Good(?) news! ####

I already have some plans for the future of this blog! Some topics I'd like to cover in the near future are:

- **VPS configuration & security** - about the infrastructure that supports this site.
- **node.js** - what have been my struggles with this environment so far?
- **REST APIs** - it might be mostly about designing and documenting APIs and the like.
- **Android** - This is what I've been doing for almost two years at [inLab FIB](http://inlab.fib.upc.edu), along with some web and iOS development.
- **Legal protection** in IT projects - I attended a short seminar on this, which I'll try to summarize the best I can, somewhen.
- **And...** some other things I won't write here, because I have not decided about them and because this list could grow too much for you to read - you'd certainly get bored.


## Some bits about me ##

I was born in Barcelona in 1992 (Olympics!!) and here I have lived ever since. It is a vibrant city, plenty of opportunities and experiences and awesome people from all over the world. I like it here, but I need to get outside  from time to time, to let off steam and, mostly, because I love open air and nature in all its essence. The Pyrenees have been my second home for many years and there is nothing I like more than hiking up mountains, getting to the top and breathing deeply all the freedom you get there. Speaking of mountains, I found a basque proverb in a mountaineering magazine that helps me keep going and pushing hard, either on a climb or in any other situation, really:

> Non gogoa, han zangoa.

Unfortunately, I don't actually speak basque, so forgive me if the translation is not accurate, but the idea is: *"where there's a will, there's a way"*.

There is one other thing comparable to my love for mountains: *cycling*. I can't recall how old was I when I rode my first bike (my parents told me once that I was three), but I know it was an orange one! I've been mountain cycling through all these years, until I got myself a road bike almost a couple of years ago. And that was indeed a good decision! I had done a couple of short distance triathlons with my mountain bike, but the path for "long" distance ones finally opened with this one! On September 2014, I finished my first half ironman triathlon, together with some good friends of mine.


#### What do I do? ####

So, apart from enjoying a hard cycle climb or a relaxing mountain trek, how do I spend the rest of my day? Well, at the time of this writing, I am undertaking a bachelor degree in [informatics engineering](http://www.fib.upc.edu/en.html), with a major in [computer science](http://www.fib.upc.edu/en/estudiar-enginyeria-informatica/especialitats-grau/computacio.html), and working at [inLab FIB](http://inlab.fib.upc.edu) as an intern, developing Android apps . These are not the only things I've been involved in at the university campus - I was an active member of the school's students assembly for a couple of years and I was involved in the school's board too, as one of the (many) students representatives.


## That is it! ##

Please come back! Please! **Pleease!**... No, really, if you enjoyed all the way through, please come back some day later to see if a new article has been released (perhaps it's about something more interesting than this). I guess I'll announce the article releases through some [tweets](https://twitter.com/nihilsinecaos) and perhaps posting them on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidmartinezrodriguez) too.

See you soon!


#### PS: No comments yet... ####

I would have liked to have a comments engine set up and running, but I haven't had the time to have a look at it yet. Send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/nihilsinecaos) or [email](mailto:davidmr.web@gmail.com) me if you want. All feedback is welcome!

And, before you tell me so, I have no theme or style applied to this blog yet... I have much work to do right now! (T.T)
