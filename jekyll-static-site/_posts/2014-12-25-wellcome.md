Hi there! I'm glad you are here, because a lot of love and effort have been put in crafting this site. So, to begin with, welcome to my blog! I hope it takes off pretty soon with some articles. But, what is this all about? Well, let me tell you!

## What goes here ##

This is a place for techie articles and techie rants and techie experiencies of any kind. It is a space to share and discuss some things I may find along the way as an Android developer, for example, or learning some bits of web development or anything related to computer science that might be interesting. I do not rule out to lay some other thoughts here too - sports, books and culture in general and, perhaps, some other more philosophical entanglements.


#### Good(?) news! ####

I already have some plans for the future of this blog! Some topics I'd like to cover in the near future are:

- **VPS configuration & security** - about the infrastructure that supports this site.
- **node.js** - what have been my struggles with this environment so far?
- **REST APIs** - it might be mostly about designing and documenting APIs and the like.
- **Android** - This is what I've been doing for almost two years at [inLab FIB](http://inlab.fib.upc.edu), along with some web and iOS development.
- **Legal protection** in IT projects - I attended a short seminar on this, which I'll try to summarize the best I can, somewhen.
- **And...** some other things I won't write here, because I have not decided about them and because this list could grow too much for you to read - you'd certainly get bored.

## That is it! ##

Please come back! Please! **Pleease!**... No, really, if you enjoyed all the way through, please come back some day later to see if a new article has been released (perhaps it's about something more interesting than this). I guess I'll announce the article releases through some [tweets](https://twitter.com/nihilsinecaos) and perhaps posting them on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidmartinezrodriguez) too.

See you soon!


#### PS: No comments yet... ####

I would have liked to have a comments engine set up and running, but I haven't had the time to have a look at it yet. Send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/nihilsinecaos) or [email](mailto:davidmr.web@gmail.com) me if you want. All feedback is welcome!

And, before you tell me so, I have no theme or style applied to this blog yet... I have much work to do right now! (T.T)
