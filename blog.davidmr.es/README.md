- 'config.js' contains the configuration changes needed
  to run the Ghost blogging engine on its corresponding
  port and pointing to the right URLs and other stuff.

- The 'articles' directory has a copy of the blog articles
  that are (yet to be) published in the Ghost blogging
  engine. It is useful to have them on the repo, in order
  to redeploy them anywhere when needed (or even to deploy
  them on any other blogging engine).
